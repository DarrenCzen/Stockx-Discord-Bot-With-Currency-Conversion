# Stockx-Discord-Bot-With-Currency-Conversion
Written in Python 3.
A StockX Discord Bot with Currency Conversion so that I dont need to use a currency converter on Google or on my phone whenever I view prices of shoes on StockX which is in USD.

PLEASE NOTE:
Close bracket value is USD and not the price of the shoe after fees. Read the code if you do not understand.
